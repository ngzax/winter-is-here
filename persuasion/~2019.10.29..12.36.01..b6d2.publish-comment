This resonates with me, as I was on my high school's debate team. My favorite was Lincoln-Douglas debate, and I spent most of my weekends at other high schools competing in tournaments. Won a couple of them, and maxed out the number of points you can get from L-D in the National Forensics League. It was my way of forcing myself to learn how to think on my feet, understand how to structure an argument, and stay present in a high pressure situation.
