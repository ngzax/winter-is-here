I feel that. Theres a tech-obesity epidemic and people seem to be pushing themselves even further towards it.

I believe a good harmony between people and tech can exist, but not like this. I think my ideal device would be something of a notebook with majority plaintext, and some minor concessions for other forms of media.

ArvoPAD when?
