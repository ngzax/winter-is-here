I like that term, "tech-obesity", ~bannum, and will probably steal it. ;)


I'm probably being unfair to people because we have been evolving for thousands of years to deal with a particular set of experiences and challenges and then *boom* literally overnight this new sensory experience gets injected. It's going to take a while before people in general can start seeing the damage it is doing and developing better coping strategies. 


We, as tech leaders, can and should definitely take the lead in evangelizing it to others.
