A lot of the blame for this I put on the design of more popular websites, apps and systems. Everything is designed using tactics that just seem exploitative, to keep people on the app for longer rather than actually increasing the usability for the user.

Like I end up thinking a lot, I think Arvo has a good chance of changing this, creating apps that work for the user, rather than working for the creator, with the user as its product.
