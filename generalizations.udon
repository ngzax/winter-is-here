From an old (2003) but prescient Clay Shirky article about the challenges faced by the "Semantic" web, ["The Semantic Web, Syllogism, and Worldview"](http://www.shirky.com/writings/semantic_syllogism.html).

  Even if we could, it wouldn't help, because generalizations are a fundamental tool of expression."
