I have a degree in studio art. Never had the desire for a technical skill, so that sits just fine with me that I went after a subject that had absolutely zero chance of leading to a specialized industry. So, I played to my strengths: talking! Sales, I think, is one of the best jobs for anyone who can learn to enjoy talking to people. It's an in-demand skill that nearly any successful company is going to value. #PsychologySells
