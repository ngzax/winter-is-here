                    oor caching.  In addition, they are frequently the hardest to decipher and fix.\0a\0aMark Nottingham has published [a nice article on HTTP caching](http://w
                    ww.mnot.net/blog/2009/02/24/unintended_caching), "Caching When You Least Expect it"\0a\0aHere\'s the main takeaway:\0a\0a> ...if you publish personalised co
                    ntent on the Web, it does mean you need to think carefully about caching.\0a\0a  The caching model in HTTP wasn’t designed with Cookie authentication in min
                    d. If you assume that no validators\0a  and no freshness means no caching, you could be caught out, badly.\0a\0a  This simplest way to fix this is to set a
                    "Cache-Control: private" directive on all personalised responses\0a  that way, shared caches know not to reuse it, while browser caches can still, so that u
                    ser experience isn’t impacted.\0a\0a  "Cache-Control: no-store" also works, but it will avoid the browser cache as well.\0a\0a'
