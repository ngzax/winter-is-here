                    ral public would understand.\0a\0aThey\'re usually too close to the project, focus on its functionality (instead of its benefits), or any number of ways to

                    I can understand why they would think so; magicians go to extraordinary lengths to create that impression. They are willing to work YEARS to develop the ski
                    lls necessary to ensure a single sleight that takes 300 milliseconds to perform is never seen by an audience.\0a\0aWith that kind of temporal disparity, I d
                    on\'t feel bad for the audience who never realizes how much dedication it takes to make magic look like, well, magic.\0a\0a;h6: Disney Internship\0aWhen I w
                    as in my last year of college I had the opportunity to participate in Disney\'s college internship program. I wanted to see how an international corporation
                     runs its operation and maintains its reputation as providing unparalleled customer service.\0a\0aI was not disappointed.\0a\0aWith a background in magic I
                    came prepared with the knowledge that appearances can be deceiving, and I knew that working for Disney would probably be a lot different than paying to visi
                    t Disney.\0a\0aI was correct.\0a\0aThat is not to say I didn\'t have a good time. Quite the contrary. I had a blast! But, what I did see were a significant
                    percentage of Disney Interns who were fired right away for treating the job like a vacation.\0a\0aThat\'s not a strategy for long term success in the Disney
                     corporation.\0a\0aI learned a lot about a lot while on the job, and I also took advantage of Disney University.\0a\0aNo, that\'s not a misprint. There\'s a
                     Disney University. It\'s where you can go to learn about leadership, branding, and all the things that make Disney, DISNEY.\0a\0aIt\'s there that I learned
                     a word that has stuck with me ever since. It\'s been a defining trait that has quietly worked its way into my philosophy of being.\0a\0aSprezzatura: "Studi

                    s\0aThere\'s virtually zero difference between a magical effect and success in business.\0a\0aThey are both the result of careful attention to details, skil
                    l development, and consistent application of intention. \0a\0aYou absolutely must 1) do the right thing, 2) in the right way, 3) at the right time in order
                    for there to be any effect. Miss any one of those, and you\'re lost.\0a\0aMaster those three and you can then get so good at it that success "just happens"
                    and then people will attribute your results as being "magical." People would rather believe in fairytales than know success looks like cardboard & duct tape
                     (which is what any professional magician will tell you holds their act together).\0a\0a;h6: Elements\0aMagic is composed of certain elements that, when in

                    0aI\'m not a programmer. I\'m not a coder. I\'m not all that technologically savvy. I\'m just good at following walkthroughs with projects that interest me.
                    \0a\0aWhat I am good at, however, is communicating ideas to large audiences. I\'m a professional communicator who has appeared on national television, radio

                    \0a2) Persuasive: You\'re trying to affect an outcome.\0a\0aIf you want people to join Urbit, you\'re going to have to use approach number 2; not approach n
                    umber 1.\0a\0aApproach number 1 is facts & figures. It\'s explaining what Urbit *is.*\0a\0aNobody (beyond most engineering types) cares what Urbit IS. They
