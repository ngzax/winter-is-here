                    and are thus going on 40 years old:\0a"Open a connection, send some text, wait for some text in response, close the connection."\0a\0aWhat is new is how tec
                    hnologists are thinking about how to design architectures using the\0aUNIX [ioctl()](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/ioctl.html) interface
                     and that\'s a good thing.\0a\0aUnfortunately, many people in our industry always seek to emphasize a highlight the "new toys."\0a\0aInnovation is more than
                     endlessly cranking out new and improved gadgets.\0aIt also consists of trying to find the best use of the tools you currently have lying around the shop.\0

                  \/'Two of the most difficult problems in Computer Science are caching and parallelism.\0a\0aI have seen many computer systems have problems as the result of p\/
                    oor caching.  In addition, they are frequently the hardest to decipher and fix.\0a\0aMark Nottingham has published [a nice article on HTTP caching](http://w
                    ww.mnot.net/blog/2009/02/24/unintended_caching), "Caching When You Least Expect it"\0a\0aHere\'s the main takeaway:\0a\0a> ...if you publish personalised co
                    ntent on the Web, it does mean you need to think carefully about caching.\0a\0a  The caching model in HTTP wasn’t designed with Cookie authentication in min
                    d. If you assume that no validators\0a  and no freshness means no caching, you could be caught out, badly.\0a\0a  This simplest way to fix this is to set a
                    "Cache-Control: private" directive on all personalised responses\0a  that way, shared caches know not to reuse it, while browser caches can still, so that u
                    ser experience isn’t impacted.\0a\0a  "Cache-Control: no-store" also works, but it will avoid the browser cache as well.\0a\0a'

                  \/'Considering that Urbit is a network built from the ground up, I figured a quick look at the world of business networking would be an interesting sidebar.\0\/
                    a\0aI\'ve traveled the world, had amazing experiences, and done things that most people only dream of due to my mastery of one skill: networking.\0a\0a+++++
                    +++++++++\0a\0aLast night was an evening that reminded me that almost nobody knows the incredible power that building a network [the right way] has to chang
                    e your life.\0a\0aThe scene: A rooftop bar in the heart of downtown Chicago. It\'s about sunset and there\'s loud music playing. Gorgeous people in form fit
                    ting suits & dresses are piling in to see and be seen.\0a\0aIt\'s my kind of party.\0a\0aIt\'s also a well curated networking event put on by an acquaintanc
                    e of mine. I designed the logo for his brand, and the deal I struck was, "I make this logo for you and I get into all your events from now to the future for
                     free."\0a\0aDeal.\0a\0aIn addition, I have an official "I\'m part of the event" name badge which is like having a VIP all access pass at a rock concert. It
                     gives me license to talk to anyone and everyone, so I do.\0a\0aMy goal is to make sure that the people who are showing up meet the people they need to meet
                     which is good for them, their new connection, the event as a whole, and me specifically for helping make business happen. \0a\0aI love it.\0a\0aBut here\'s
                     what happens.\0a\0aI walk up to a group and scream over the music, "Hi! My name is Jonathan! Welcome to the event, I\'m glad you\'re here. My job is to mak
                    e sure you get the most out of being here, so who do you want to meet?"\0a\0aWhat\'s the most common answer?\0a\0aThem: "Oh, anyone really!"\0a\0aAnd I inst
                    antly know I can\'t help them.\0a\0aIf your ideal client is everyone, it\'s noone.\0a\0aIf there are zero filters in place, I can\'t tell who would be a goo
                    d connection vs a bad connection.\0a\0aThe instant they say "anyone/everyone" I know they\'re just there to oogle the pretty people and have some drinks.\0a
                    \0a<Don\'t get me wrong, that\'s a GREAT past time.>\0a\0aBut they\'re missing out on some incredible opportunities.\0a\0aThat event is where I met the guy
                    who is spearheading 5G implementation for a major telecommunications corporation. From that connection I\'ll be speaking/engaging at a couple C-Suite events
                     for that company in the near future.\0a\0a++++++++++++++++\0a\0aSo, what\'s the lesson?\0a\0aKnow 1) who your ideal client is. 2) what you can do for them
                    3) how to explain this to someone who might know them.\0a\0aYou absolutely have to have those things rock solid in your mind, and be able to clearly communi
                    cate it [quickly] to someone who is clearly offering to help you.\0a\0aThis is the only way your network can grow.\0a\0a~Minder-Folden\0a'

                    ap & purveyors of flim-flam. There is, however, a rational approach to making change in your life by a process I like to call a reasonable unreasonableness.
                    \0a\0aThis is Life Alchemy.\0a\0aBut, first, I want to introduce you to this guy. He’s one of the most influential people in all of human history.\0a\0aWe’v
                    e gotten to the moon because of what he dreamt up. We’re currently looking into how the universe will die based on his thinking.\0a\0aHe also proudly died a
                     virgin.\0a\0aHis name? Sir Isaac Newton.\0a\0aFather of:\0a\0aLaws of Gravity, \0aLaw of Thermodynamics, \0aLaw of Motion, \0aUnderstanding Light, \0aFluid
                     Dynamics, \0aCalculus, \0a\0aHis work is the bedrock of some of our most valuable achievements as human beings.\0a\0aHe was also obsessed with Biblical Chr
                    onology.\0a\0aThere’s another area he devoted a significant amount of his time exploring: Alchemy.\0a\0aIn today’s context, Alchemy is relegated to sorcery,
                     magic, and other fairytale adventures that have no merit. Unfortunately, this is at the detriment of maximizing potential.\0a\0aWhy did Newton write millio
                    n+ words about Alchemy? What could have possibly driven one of the greatest scientific minds to folly?\0a\0aSurely it was the counterbalance of ignorance an
                    d wrong-headedness to someone who achieved so much? Capacity for greatness goes both ways, right?\0a\0aNot really.\0a\0aAlchemy, as it was back then, was co
                    ncerned with understanding the nature of reality. The fundamental philosophy was essentially “If you understand exactly how nature works, you’ll be able to
                    shape it to your will.”\0a\0aIt’s actually pretty spot on.\0a\0aAlchemist believed that all matter, and especially metals, were all manifestations of the sa
                    me spirit or essence.\0a\0aGold was considered to be the highest manifestation of this spiritual achievement whereas something like lead was a ‘base’ metal;
                     as in at the base of the hierarchy.\0a\0aBase: Lacking higher qualities of mind, spirit, or value. Degrading. Inferior.\0a\0aDebase:To reduce something in
                    value or quality; degrade.\0a\0aAbase:Behave in a way so as to belittle or degrade (someone)\0a\0aAlchemists sought to understand how to take base materials
                     and create value.\0a\0aThey believed they would be able to discern the process that was responsible for lead becoming more and more refined until achieving
                     its highest potential; gold.\0a\0aThe method, process, or force responsible for this happening was referred to as ‘The Philosopher’s Stone.”\0a\0aThey were
                    n’t searching for an actual, physical stone. They weren’t some kind of sorcerer version of Indiana Jones on a mission to find the Holy Grail.\0a\0aThe stone
                     was short-hand for ‘the singular process responsible for taking something worthless, and making it valuable.’\0a\0aWhen you understand the historical conte
                    xt, and the time they were operating in, it makes perfect sense that Alchemy was a sensible endeavor. It’s proto-science, in a manner of speaking.\0a\0aBut
                    to disregard its message today is to dismiss a powerful rational lesson.\0a\0aThere is an Alchemy that’s alive and well today. To understand its inner worki
                    ngs is to create a life that appears impossible to anyone who doesn’t understand its principles.\0a\0aEveryone is a slave to its effects, but few master its
                     causes.\0a\0aThere’s a base metal, a philosopher’s stone, and a gold if we want to use this as a metaphor.\0a\0aThe base metal? Time.\0a\0aEveryone has exa
                    ctly the same amount. In fact it’s so plentiful that most people waste it. There’s so much time that they can afford to spend it on Netflix.\0a\0aTime is yo
                    ur Lead.\0a\0aUseless by itself. Not good for much. Almost anything is better than just having time on your hands. What good is time by itself?\0a\0aBut! Th
                    ere’s that equation you’re ignoring!\0a\0aTime = Money! “Got you!” you cry.\0a\0aNot so fast.\0a\0aIf Time = Money, then we’d all be rich. We’d all drive Fe
                    rraris, and spend our vacations on one of our several yachts.\0a\0aSo why is time so valuable to some, and not at all to others?\0a\0aAnswer: The Philosophe
                    r’s Stone\0a\0aThere’s one thing that can change worthless, abundant time into something valuable. What is it?\0a\0aYour mind.\0a\0aThat’s it. That’s the ph
                    ilosopher’s stone. Your mind is the miraculous thing that is responsible for all value in the world. All meaning. All worth.\0a\0aThis is why all the intern
                    et gurus (real & fake) explain that it’s mindset that’s so important. This is why.\0a\0aTime is the abundant resource, and the quality of your thinking, ima
                    gination, and creativity is the Philosopher’s Stone that will transmute that time into value.\0a\0aTime = Money is an equation that only holds up if you kno
                    w how to trade your time for dollars.\0a\0aYour job is the best strategy that your mind has figured out how to convert time into dollars. Your pay the measu

                    That’s it.\0a\0aNow, you might argue and say, “People get paid millions for being an idiot! That’s proof you’re wrong.”\0a\0aNo. That’s proof you lack imagi

                    I can understand why they would think so; magicians go to extraordinary lengths to create that impression. They are willing to work YEARS to develop the ski
                    lls necessary to ensure a single sleight that takes 300 milliseconds to perform is never seen by an audience.\0a\0aWith that kind of temporal disparity, I d
                    on\'t feel bad for the audience who never realizes how much dedication it takes to make magic look like, well, magic.\0a\0a;h6: Disney Internship\0aWhen I w
                    as in my last year of college I had the opportunity to participate in Disney\'s college internship program. I wanted to see how an international corporation
                     runs its operation and maintains its reputation as providing unparalleled customer service.\0a\0aI was not disappointed.\0a\0aWith a background in magic I
                    came prepared with the knowledge that appearances can be deceiving, and I knew that working for Disney would probably be a lot different than paying to visi
                    t Disney.\0a\0aI was correct.\0a\0aThat is not to say I didn\'t have a good time. Quite the contrary. I had a blast! But, what I did see were a significant
                    percentage of Disney Interns who were fired right away for treating the job like a vacation.\0a\0aThat\'s not a strategy for long term success in the Disney
                     corporation.\0a\0aI learned a lot about a lot while on the job, and I also took advantage of Disney University.\0a\0aNo, that\'s not a misprint. There\'s a
                     Disney University. It\'s where you can go to learn about leadership, branding, and all the things that make Disney, DISNEY.\0a\0aIt\'s there that I learned
                     a word that has stuck with me ever since. It\'s been a defining trait that has quietly worked its way into my philosophy of being.\0a\0aSprezzatura: "Studi

                    s\0aThere\'s virtually zero difference between a magical effect and success in business.\0a\0aThey are both the result of careful attention to details, skil
                    l development, and consistent application of intention. \0a\0aYou absolutely must 1) do the right thing, 2) in the right way, 3) at the right time in order
                    for there to be any effect. Miss any one of those, and you\'re lost.\0a\0aMaster those three and you can then get so good at it that success "just happens"
                    and then people will attribute your results as being "magical." People would rather believe in fairytales than know success looks like cardboard & duct tape
                     (which is what any professional magician will tell you holds their act together).\0a\0a;h6: Elements\0aMagic is composed of certain elements that, when in

                     cards. (Coin included for scale and artistic panache.)\0a\0aWhile I was practicing my cuts and shuffles I meditated on the nature of what makes playing car
                    ds so beautiful to me.\0a\0aIt\'s not just their visual & textural appeal; it\'s their non-apparent complexity. But, before I dig into that idea I want to p
                    oint you in an interesting direction.\0a\0aA friend of mine is a magician who is a heavy hitter. His technical skills are (literally) world class and he sai
                    d something off-handedly that caught my attention. He said, "Our audiences experience what we do mainly through the sense of sight while we experience it mo
                    stly through the sense of touch."\0a\0aHe\'s right.\0a\0aAudiences are watching very closely and they see nothing. Magicians, however, can feel EVERYTHING.
                    Their fingers can keep track of a single card that\'s less than a millimeter out of alignment with the deck, and maintain its relative position to the other
                     cards during a shuffle. It\'s mind blowing.\0a\0aBut I digress.\0a\0aEnough dexterity talk, more complexity talk.\0a\0aPlaying cards are a microcosm of the
                     universe at large. It seems relatively simple and you think you understand how it works.\0a\0a"There are 52 options, I jumble them up, and now it\'s really
                     mixed up."\0a\0aWhat you don\'t realize is it\'s SO mixed up, that you\'ll NEVER see that particular sequence of cards ever again just by shuffling. There
                    are so many ways that the cards can be sequenced than stars in our galaxy.\0a\0aIt\'s truly an astronomical number.\0a\0aIf you aren\'t familiar with just h
                    ow big a number that is, make sure you google "52 factorial" or 52!. You\'ll be glad you did.\0a'

                    r 7, 1805 and died June 13, 1871. This man is responsible for the image you see in your mind when you picture a magician. He was the first magician to dress
                     like his audiences at the time; in a top hat and tails. Before him magicians wore robes, cone hats, and performed wearing similar relics of the mystical ag
                    e.\0a\0aJean Eugene updated the look, and nothing has changed since!\0a\0aBut, he also did a lot more than revamp the magician aesthetic. He was engaged by
                    the French government for a secret mission.\0a\0a;h1: Uprising\0aThe French government had a strong presence in Algeria (Northern Africa), and the local peo
                    ple didn’t appreciate their being there. Some of the traditional magicians (who were more like shamans & spiritual leaders than the performer magician you m
                    ight be thinking of,) were claiming they had strong magic that would protect anyone fighting the invasion. Consequently there were riots and lots of pushbac
                    k.\0a\0aThen someone in the government had a bright idea: let’s bring in our own magician.\0a\0aSo they called Jean Eugene and explained the situation. He j
                    umped at the chance and went on a tour of Algeria challenging the local magicians to a “rap battle” of sorts, but with magic.\0a\0a;h1: The Light & Heavy Ch

                    ne of their strength using mere suggestion and hypnotism through the his incredible magical powers. Anyone who didn’t believe him was welcome to prove him w
                    rong.\0a\0aOne brave volunteer steps forward in defiance. Jean Eugene waved his hands in the direction of the rival magician muttering under his breath, as
                    though to cast a secret incantation. Then the rival was invited to lift the box.\0a\0aHe couldn’t.\0a\0aNo matter how much he struggled and strained, the bo
                    x remained unmoved. The Algerian magician is defeated, and to add insult to injury, the child would lift the box again to show no trickery had been used; on
                    ly pure magic.\0a\0aJean Eugene would reinstate the Algerian magician’s powers with a warning to stop attacking the French representatives.\0a\0aHe would ne

                    There was an important port along the river that the British government needed to protect from constant bombardment by enemy forces. Jasper had an stroke of
                     genius: let’s create a scale replica of the city with the same patterns of lights that, when viewed from 10,000+ feet in the air, would look identical to t
                    he real thing!\0a\0aThe plan was put into action.\0a\0aSeveral miles away from the real city British forces created the Potemkin village complete with scale
                     model buildings, but it was the lights that needed to be exactly right. When it was completed, the real city went to blackout, and the lights of the fake o
                    ne were turned on.\0a\0aThen they waited for the bombers.\0a\0aThis was the moment of truth. Would the pilots trust their instruments which would lead them
                    straight to the real thing, or would they trust their eyes and adjust course?\0a\0aFortunately, the pilots thought “Seeing is believing” and changed their f
                    light path to the fake city, and that’s how Jasper saved the port.\0a\0aBut the deception didn’t end there.\0a\0aHe had artists paint craters on giant piece
                    s of canvas to match how the shadows would look at different times of the day. That way, when the reconnaissance planes flew high overhead, the real city ap
                    peared to be damaged from the previous night’s raid.\0a\0aMagicians think of everything.\0a\0a;h1: The Lesson\0aWhen thousands of lives were on the line, an
