                    s afraid if you knew some facts that adults intentionally do not explain to you. I’ll tell you here.\0a\0a  The news was once a source of real information,
                    or so we thought. But in the modern world, the news people discovered they can make more money by presenting scary news regardless of whether it is true or
                    not. Today, much of the news on the right and the left is opinion that is meant to scare you, not inform you, because scary things get more attention, and t
                    hat makes the news business more profitable. The same is true for people who write books; authors often make books scary so you will buy them. Most adults k
                    now all the scariness is not real. Most kids do not. You just learned it.\0a\0a  Nuclear energy used to be dangerous, back in the olden days. Today’s nuclea
                    r power plants (the ones built in the past 20 years all over the world) have killed zero people, and are considered the safest form of energy in the world.
                    More people have died installing solar panels and falling off roofs than have died from nuclear power problems anywhere in the world for the past few decade
                    s. And nuclear energy is the obvious way to address climate change, say most of the smartest adults in the world, because it can provide abundant, cheap, cl
                    ean energy with zero carbon emissions.\0a\0a  -- ["A Message for Children About Climate Change"](https://www.scottadamssays.com/2019/09/23/a-message-for-chi
                    ldren-about-climate-change/)\0a\0a\0aThe saddest thing is that, indeed, only "most" adults know it. And many of those who do know it are the ones pushing th

                    nd I did skim a bit. From the jump, the conceit of the author is astounding. He claims to be explaining "the principles of Peter Thiel’s worldview" while si

                     nice payoff.\0a\0aIn particular, I had never really thought about the importance of people modeling themselves after others and using them as their measure
                     of success. And that you need to break out of that cycle to do anything truly great.\0a\0a> When you compete to be the best, you imitate. When you compete
                    to be unique, you innovate. In business, multiple winners can thrive and coexist. You don’t have to annihilate your competition. While imitation creates a r

                    g arts there are many entertaining singers and actors, each with a distinct style. The more talented and differentiated performers there are, the more the a

                    e is the conclusion in which he return to Thiel\'s own words to sum up how he ties how he recommends we should live directly to the Ten Commandments:\0a\0a>
                     The first commandment says that we should only look to God. There is only one God and you should worship him. Look up, not around. Follow The Bible, which
                    says there is no salvation in anyone other than Jesus. You won’t figure out what to do by looking at your peers, so don’t copy the people around you. Instea

                    our neighbor’s goods. Inspired by the 10th commandment, Thiel encourages listeners to avoid competition. True to Mimetic Theory, the last commandment focuse

                     Rather than using your peers as a reference point, find your own transcendent orientation. \0a\0aIn the end, it\'s worth a read.\0a\0a\0a\0a'

                    he optimal selection, inventory, and pricing of SKUs that a local market could support. It was bound, or constrained, by the characteristics of the local ec
                    onomy, and so each Walmart location was a direct reflection of the local market dynamics.\0a\0a...\0a\0a> The advent of the internet – of online shopping –
                    meant that an online retailer had infinite shelf space. While Amazon did not have the capital to stock every SKU on the planet, nor a warehouse large enough
                     to do so, it didn’t have a constraint on the actual ‘shelves’ themselves. An online retailer would be limited not by each local market, but by the economic
                    s and behavior of the national or international population at large.\0a\0a...\0a\0a> Bezos, in other words, wanted to build an _unbounded_ Walmart. ... And
                    with this insight, Amazon did not need to be nearly as good – let alone better – than Walmart at Walmart’s masterful game of vendor and SKU selection. Amazo
                    n just needed to be faster at aggregating SKUs – and therefore faster at onboarding vendors.\0a\0a...\0a\0a> Amazon, by contrast, is an illustration of what
                     happens when a massive global market is freed by the internet from the geographical constraints that previously kept it manageable; it is an illustration o
                    f what happens when you enter a problem space so large that you have to bypass the human element altogether. What was just barely solvable with carefully-bu
                    ilt systems at Walmart’s scale of shelf space would have been impossible to solve with shelf space that stretched on to infinity. Amazon had to find a way o
                    f abdicating responsibility for solving these problems altogether; with Marketplace, Amazon had begun to grasp at a solution that would do exactly that.\0a\

                    Truth be told, its getting a little grating when I look in the twitter feed from the Discord, and see all these people going on like speed is the one thing
                    that matters more than anything else on the planet.\0a\0aTo be frank, I really think it shouldnt matter.\0a\0aJets as a system allow for decent enough speed
                     where we need it. We may not have some of the niceties yet, like programmatic proof that a jet has the exact same results for the domain as the Hoon code,
                    yet surely some Rust person will eventually magic that into existence.\0a\0aSure, Hoon could be a bit more explicitly typed, but overall, its a fun language
                     that you can achieve a lot in, in /decent/ time.\0a\0aAnd thats fine. We need to slow down our computations so that people can learn to live again.\0a\0aWe
                     have a system where its actually somewhat feasible to become an expert in the ins and outs of the /entire/ operating system, in much less time than a lifet

                    has.\0a\0aI really really love this system, but theres one part that I think needs there to be discussion over.\0a\0aWhile traditionally I would much prefer
                     some sort of open federation style system, I can both understand and appreciate the benefits we get from the current system of points, and unlike some peop
                    le I\'m not about to head on to twitter and sling insults over it.\0a\0aIt feels almost like were in the section of Urbits history when we don\'t know what
                    we have. Forgive me for the somewhat political analogy here, but it seems like something very anti-urbit-environmentalist, in that comets are seen as essent
                    ially infinite, and planets seem incredibly abundant.\0a\0aFor all intents and purposes they are, at least currently, and comets in particular are basically
                     infinite forever, but not exactly.\0a\0aTo live up to this idea of a “Forever System” it seems off that were all so casual about this net negative to the s
                    pace of usable addresses in the system, over time we\'re only ever losing points, either to comets that are deleted or forgotten, planets that get forgotten
                    , or sunk and the keys lost to time, hell, even the (i assume) hundreds of stars that were bought by investors looking for a quick buck that dont actually c
                    are about the project outside of converting that star to fiat currency.\0a\0aIn practice, this probably wont matter, we have more than enough for our entire
                     lifetimes, and many lifetimes after that, but to me it seems to go against the Urbit Spirit.\0a\0aWhat can we do? Outside of someone creating a fork of the
                     project that moves to a federated model, which for the record I believe would be a negative to this project, I would like to propose something, a moral imp
