                    pproach to making change in your life by a process I like to call a reasonable unreasonableness.\0a\0aThis is Life Alchemy.\0a\0aBut, first, I want to introduce you to this guy. He’s one of the most influential peopl
                    e in all of human history.\0a\0aWe’ve gotten to the moon because of what he dreamt up. We’re currently looking into how the universe will die based on his thinking.\0a\0aHe also proudly died a virgin.\0a\0aHis name?
                    Sir Isaac Newton.\0a\0aFather of:\0a\0aLaws of Gravity, \0aLaw of Thermodynamics, \0aLaw of Motion, \0aUnderstanding Light, \0aFluid Dynamics, \0aCalculus, \0a\0aHis work is the bedrock of some of our most valuable a
                    chievements as human beings.\0a\0aHe was also obsessed with Biblical Chronology.\0a\0aThere’s another area he devoted a significant amount of his time exploring: Alchemy.\0a\0aIn today’s context, Alchemy is relegated
                     to sorcery, magic, and other fairytale adventures that have no merit. Unfortunately, this is at the detriment of maximizing potential.\0a\0aWhy did Newton write million+ words about Alchemy? What could have possibly
                     driven one of the greatest scientific minds to folly?\0a\0aSurely it was the counterbalance of ignorance and wrong-headedness to someone who achieved so much? Capacity for greatness goes both ways, right?\0a\0aNot r
                    eally.\0a\0aAlchemy, as it was back then, was concerned with understanding the nature of reality. The fundamental philosophy was essentially “If you understand exactly how nature works, you’ll be able to shape it to
                    your will.”\0a\0aIt’s actually pretty spot on.\0a\0aAlchemist believed that all matter, and especially metals, were all manifestations of the same spirit or essence.\0a\0aGold was considered to be the highest manifes
                    tation of this spiritual achievement whereas something like lead was a ‘base’ metal; as in at the base of the hierarchy.\0a\0aBase: Lacking higher qualities of mind, spirit, or value. Degrading. Inferior.\0a\0aDebase
                    :To reduce something in value or quality; degrade.\0a\0aAbase:Behave in a way so as to belittle or degrade (someone)\0a\0aAlchemists sought to understand how to take base materials and create value.\0a\0aThey believe
                    d they would be able to discern the process that was responsible for lead becoming more and more refined until achieving its highest potential; gold.\0a\0aThe method, process, or force responsible for this happening
                    was referred to as ‘The Philosopher’s Stone.”\0a\0aThey weren’t searching for an actual, physical stone. They weren’t some kind of sorcerer version of Indiana Jones on a mission to find the Holy Grail.\0a\0aThe stone
                     was short-hand for ‘the singular process responsible for taking something worthless, and making it valuable.’\0a\0aWhen you understand the historical context, and the time they were operating in, it makes perfect se
                    nse that Alchemy was a sensible endeavor. It’s proto-science, in a manner of speaking.\0a\0aBut to disregard its message today is to dismiss a powerful rational lesson.\0a\0aThere is an Alchemy that’s alive and well
                    today. To understand its inner workings is to create a life that appears impossible to anyone who doesn’t understand its principles.\0a\0aEveryone is a slave to its effects, but few master its causes.\0a\0aThere’s a
                    base metal, a philosopher’s stone, and a gold if we want to use this as a metaphor.\0a\0aThe base metal? Time.\0a\0aEveryone has exactly the same amount. In fact it’s so plentiful that most people waste it. There’s s
                    o much time that they can afford to spend it on Netflix.\0a\0aTime is your Lead.\0a\0aUseless by itself. Not good for much. Almost anything is better than just having time on your hands. What good is time by itself?\
                    0a\0aBut! There’s that equation you’re ignoring!\0a\0aTime = Money! “Got you!” you cry.\0a\0aNot so fast.\0a\0aIf Time = Money, then we’d all be rich. We’d all drive Ferraris, and spend our vacations on one of our se
                    veral yachts.\0a\0aSo why is time so valuable to some, and not at all to others?\0a\0aAnswer: The Philosopher’s Stone\0a\0aThere’s one thing that can change worthless, abundant time into something valuable. What is i

                  \/';img@"https://i.imgur.com/pp6Fyhu.jpg";\0a\0aMy ex wife was (and still is, I guess) a massage therapist.\0a\0aBeing her practice dummy was an especially nice perk of her training, and one day she mentioned a princip\/
                    le that I\'ve long-since recognized as incredibly important across domains:\0a\0a;h2: Maintain connection.\0aIf you didn\'t know to look for it, you may never notice it, but if you\'ve ever gone to get a massage, the
                     therapist (if they\'re worth their salt) will almost never break their connection with you.\0a\0aIt\'s very subtle, but if they ignore this point it leads to a very jarring experience when you\'re floating on the ta
                    ble and then they touch you. That binary switch flip from "No connection" to "someone\'s touching me" is really deep in our wiring and it connects directly to the "is this situation a threat?" circuit.\0a\0aOnce the
                    therapist makes connection with you, your mind knows right where they are, what they\'re doing, and where they\'re going. There\'s no surprise.\0a\0aIt\'s not that you\'re in control, but you settle down because you
                    have a lot of information you wouldn\'t have otherwise.\0a\0a;h2: Other places\0aLike I said, this principle plays out in many dynamics.\0a\0aOne of my favorites is in kung fu. Wing Chun kung fu, to be specific.\0a\0
                    aThere\'s a practice called "Chi Sau" which loosely translates to "sticky hands" but I prefer the term "sensing hands."\0a\0aThe idea is you and your opponent are not touching. If you want to keep track of what they\
                    're doing, you have to rely completely on your sense of sight. If, however, you\'re able to bridge the distance between the two of you, and make contact with them, then you have a direct proprioceptive conduit to the
                    ir intention.\0a\0aThis is a valuable connection!\0a\0aOnce you make contact, do not lose it.\0a\0aChi Sau is an exercise where you develop the "listening" skillset of feeling the other person\'s movements and using
                    that knowledge to make better tactical decisions without having to think about it.\0a\0aThere\'s a lot there to think about. Distill, cross apply, and amplify in your own domain.\0a\0a~mind-folden\0a\0a'

                     in Algeria (Northern Africa), and the local people didn’t appreciate their being there. Some of the traditional magicians (who were more like shamans & spiritual leaders than the performer magician you might be thin
                    king of,) were claiming they had strong magic that would protect anyone fighting the invasion. Consequently there were riots and lots of pushback.\0a\0aThen someone in the government had a bright idea: let’s bring in
                     our own magician.\0a\0aSo they called Jean Eugene and explained the situation. He jumped at the chance and went on a tour of Algeria challenging the local magicians to a “rap battle” of sorts, but with magic.\0a\0a;

                     an interpreter, he invited a child to lift the box which was done fairly easily.\0a\0aThen he claimed he could rob anyone of their strength using mere suggestion and hypnotism through the his incredible magical powe

                    At first, they didn’t know what to make of him, but he quickly showed his usefulness through several demonstrations of innovative camouflage techniques learned from hiding the secret workings of stage props, and othe

                    entical to the real thing!\0a\0aThe plan was put into action.\0a\0aSeveral miles away from the real city British forces created the Potemkin village complete with scale model buildings, but it was the lights that nee
