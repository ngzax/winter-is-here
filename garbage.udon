Interesting recycling facts from ["For Most Things, Recycling Harms the Environment"](https://www.aier.org/article/most-things-recycling-harms-environment) by Michael Minger of the American Institute for Economic Research

> "I have sometimes suggested a test for whether something is garbage or a valuable commodity. Hold it in your hand, or hold a cup of it, or tank, or however you can handle it. Consider: Will someone pay me for this? If the answer is yes, it’s a commodity, a valuable resource. If the answer is no, meaning you have to pay them to take it, then it’s garbage."
