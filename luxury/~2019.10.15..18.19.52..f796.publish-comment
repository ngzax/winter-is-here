Yes, I've had similar arguments with people who can't fully accept the implications of genes and culture co-evolving. This is acceptable to bring up with regards to lactose intolerance or cooking food increasing brain size, but it's too hot to handle if you suggest traditional gender roles in patriarchal societies have also been selected for. But that we're at the point we are now suggests that our combination of genes and culture is maladaptive, and that a messy process of natural selection is about to ensue.
