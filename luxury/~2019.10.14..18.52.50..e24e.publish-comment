re: market failure... i see this too and it is worrisome. we are seeing a massive  social engineering experiment play out in almost real-time due to cultural and technological changes. It is both scary and fascinating. One of the things that has always mystified me is that the same people who will argue with you (with little actual knowledge, mind you) that "you can't question muh evolution!" can't even begin to contemplate the idea that societal and cultural norms may *also* have evolved into what they are today and that arbitrarily changing them because they are inconvenient to _you_ *right now* might have adverse consequences. :)
