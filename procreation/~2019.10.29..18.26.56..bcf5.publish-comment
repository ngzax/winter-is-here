There are folks who point to the nuclear family as a fairly recent invention as proof that we don't need to live in tight family units, and that single parent households are no more at risk of future trouble than anything else. To me, that's a specious claim. We've lived even MORE communally for most of our human existence. With the trajectory of happiness, number of people on antidepressants, etc. (shakes magic 8 ball) Outlook not good.
