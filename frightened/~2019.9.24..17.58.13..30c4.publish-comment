Yeah. I have been in the energy industry for about half of my career and I have always marveled at the irrational fear of nuclear power. It must be somehow wrapped up in people's minds with nuclear weapons and huge explosions. And then all the overhype around Three Mile Island's "melt down" (which didn't release any radiation) right when that China Syndrome movie came out sealed it for many people.
