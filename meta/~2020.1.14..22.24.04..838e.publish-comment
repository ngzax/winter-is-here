I read the whole Meaningness website recently and found it tremendously enjoyable. Wanting more, I've started going through the "Further Reading" page (https://meaningness.com/further-reading), starting with Dreyfus' "Being in the World" because I've already read Nietzsche. I'm not really getting it so far, but I'm hoping some Youtube lectures will help.
