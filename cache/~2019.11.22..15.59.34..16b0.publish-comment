I agree.  However, I think of it like this: It only took one smart talented teenager with tons of time on his hands to jailbreak the iPhone. He releases his tools and millions of people that know nothing of the technical aspects can jailbreak their iPhones too.  It's going to be the same whether it's urbit or anything else. If someone can read it in the first place they fundamentally have the keys to unlock the content.  Even if Urbit can build a solution to make it difficult or impossible to copy the content, if urbit isn't running on an embedded solution on protected hardware, what's to say you can't just intercept the content on the way to the display.  And so and so forth.  I think it's a fools errand to try to prevent that, but I'm totally open to being proven wrong.
