Personally, I am not sure. I do really like your idea of the encrypted cache as well. One of the things that I hope urbit manages to "figure out" is how can you give someone access to content on a provisional basis, user by user like you cite, but also on a temporal basis. For example, snapchat-like content that would be read/viewed once and then disappear.
