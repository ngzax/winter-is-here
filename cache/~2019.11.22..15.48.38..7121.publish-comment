I agree with you that you can never solve the problem with someone taking a screen shot or putting a tap on the audio and capturing it that way. 

But I guess I can envision a future urbit in which the following scenario would be possible: I read an article by pulling it from another planet. It is now cached in my planet's state. After some duration the other planet sends a message to my planet asking it to remove that article from cache. I can't read it anymore. I guess someone with enough knowledge could get in and mess up the plumbing (ignore all messages of that type, perhaps), but that would be highly specialized knowledge at that point.
