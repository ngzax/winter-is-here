Additional thought, seems like something like that concept of secure, encrypted, revokable (purgeable on demand by content owner?) is something urbit that would make a lot of sense if social media users and bloggers with tons of followers distributed all over the world wanted to use it.  Otherwise you would need a very powerful "ship" in a well connected data center with tons of bandwidth or else the experience would suck.  It might be difficult or impossible for people that maintain large followings with current technology.
