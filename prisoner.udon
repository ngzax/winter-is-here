If you haven't seen it. You should.

From the [great review of when it was re-issued on DVD 5 years ago.](https://www.counter-currents.com/2014/06/patrick-mcgoohans-the-prisoner/)

> A&E’s DVD (and Blu-ray) release of The Prisoner bills this cult series as “television’s first
  masterpiece.” In truth, it is probably television’s only masterpiece. The Prisoner is a triumph
  of acting, photography, design, writing, and thought. More generally, of course, it is a triumph
  of audacity and imagination. Like a great work of art, it is timeless. Very little about The
  Prisoner is dated—even though it went into production forty-five years ago. For the most part,
  the series looks as fresh as it did when first aired. And its message seems more relevant than
  ever.
