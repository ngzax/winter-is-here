You got me all frothed up and expecting to have a Ten Minutes Hate, but besides the inaccurate framing you discussed I don’t have much to object to about the article. (The logically consistent usage of the term “reactionary” instead of the post hoc left-wing version is by itself almost enough to make me rate any article 5/5 stars though, so I’m biased.)

The author seems to have actually believed all the Valley spin about the disruptive internet utopia they were creating in the late 90s, early 00s. The money people never really believed it though, they just appropriated the language of the handful of true Digital Prophets to scam investors. They had no real vision beyond taking the cuts of various middle men for themselves. They all said that the internet was going to be as (or even more) important than the printing press, but they didn't stop to ask themselves, "What if that's literally true?"

The top SVers were as horrified as the rest of their caste that the internet actually was a technology of liberation. They couldn't conceive of a meaningful Freedom of Speech that wasn't synonymous with Freedom of the Press until it had overtaken them. And by then, Freedom of Speech was already influencing democracy like Freedom of the Press used to. And as we've all heard, "When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression".
