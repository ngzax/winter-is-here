I recently needed to recover my urbit notebook from a crashed :publish application. (The state has gotten corrupted somehow. Here is how I recovered it. *NOTE:* You must have an exported copy of your entire notebook before you do this. This is done by mounting your pier's %home to unix. Make sure you move it out of the way before you breach your pier. One nice thing I discovered is that this does preserve all the comments.

#### Step 1: Personal Breach (thanks to ~palfun-foslup for this)

1) shut down your running ship, archive its directory.

2) using bridge, go to the "configure keys" page and check the box for breaking continuity. wait for the transaction to confirm, and then wait another five minutes for good measure: the network needs to know about this. If you have another planet or a comet you can watch for the "~pier has sunk" message in the terminal.

3) using your new keyfile, boot your ship from scratch boot the new pier with your new keys


#### Step 2: Notebook Recovery


[the following assumes that you have your old pier archived in pier/planet-old, your reborn planet is in pier/planet and your notebook is named "notes"]

sync your home dir out to unix in the dojo: 

```
dojo> |mount %home
```

switch to unix:

```
$ cd pier/planet/home/web
$ mkdir publish
$ cd publish
```

copy over the entire old notes directory into the new planet:

```
cp -r pier/planet-old/home/web/publish/notes .
```

Hop back into the urbit dojo: 

```
dojo> |commit %home
dojo> :publish &publish-action [%serve %notes]
```

That's it.
