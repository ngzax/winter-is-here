I'm on a digitalocean droplet. I'm a complete n00b. I didn't understand that typing in the password shows no feedback so I thought my terminal was broken. For a couple DAYS until someone pointed it out. I stuck with it b/c my brain is wired to enjoy wonky problems like this. Having said all that, I probably would have enjoyed push button functionality even more. X^D Glad people who know how to make that happen are actively working on solutions.
