I think the initial hysterical global warming narrative was partly well intentioned: scare the rubes into taking action, because if we tell them the truth about how long it will take for there to be any noticeable effect there won't be any incentive to do so. We're now firmly in Boy, Wolf, & Crying territory where the best thing to do -- if they actually wanted to stop anthropogenic climate change -- would be to come clean about their deception. 

But it's eschatology now and cognitive dissonance has taken over. The past false predictions require more fervent belief and evangelism. I wish they'd all just wear hairshirts instead.
