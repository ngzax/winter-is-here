Thanks. NOTE: I am not sure the status of this right now, but after i wrote this the first time, ~minder-folden and i determined that if you didn't actually create your notebook via landscape first, people couldn't subscribe later. So the process became: 1) create notebook with same name in Landscape, 2) unserve, 3) copy, 4) commit, 5) serve.
