~botter: thanks for the link, interesting read. I particularly agree with "We are not adequately teaching young adults how to be rational, systematic, or modern." I see this again and again in how many young adults who can't get beyond, "i heard someone say that guy was bad and here's these couple hundred of cherry picked words out of his literally millions of written words, so I better not read anything by him lest I become infected." It's truly sad. When I was young engaging with "unusual" ideas was encouraged.
