Yeah, this analysis is correct. The biggest obstacle to understanding what Intersectionality is Jordan Peterson, who called these people “Post-modern neo-Marxists”. They’re neither. They subscribe to a universalist, hegemonic, and totalizing ideology that any postmodernist would immediately reject. Their concept of a “white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy” that’s the source of all problems is the grandest of Grand Narratives.

The best explanation I’ve seen of how we got here is this: https://meaningness.com/metablog/stem-fluidity-bridge He thinks trying to teach post-modernism/meta-rationality (Kegan’s 5th Stage) to people who were stuck at stage 3 or 4 is the cause of our current pseudo-pomo crisis. We’ve got epigones of epigones teaching their students corrupted forms of ideas they don’t understand themselves.
